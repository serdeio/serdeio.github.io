# SERDE

We are serde.io and our mission is simple. We want to bring the value of data to everyone. 

**Data Analytics, Fast** - In seconds, your cloud-scale event ingestion endpoint is ready to receive events and built on the serverless architecture, you only pay for what you use. Able to scale up to many thousands of events **per second** but costs nothing when idle, this is the right way to do analytics.

**Data Analytics, For Everyone** - Most cloud providers allow for many thousands of requests and several GB of storage per month with a free tier. When deployed to a website that only serves a few thousand requests per month this essentially costs nothing. Growing past the free tier is painless, without the need for an engineer to scale the infrastructure up or monitor it's health. We are unlocking the ability for **everyone**, regardless of size to mine their own data for insights about their users. 

**Data Analytics, For You** -  Deployed into your AWS account* you own the data, not some third party. Privacy is important for everyone. Your user interactions should be accessible to you without turning your data over to someone else or without paying a huge amount of money. With flexible consumption models, serde.io grows with your website. 

* Azure and Google compute coming soon
